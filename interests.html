<p class="subtitle">“Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.” - Harper Lee</p>

<p class="subtitle">From a young age of 8, I discovered the enchanting world of books and became an avid reader. My favorite genre is romance, where I lose myself in tales of love, passion, and heartfelt connections. As a reader, I believe in the magic of words and the worlds they create. "A book is a dream that you hold in your hands," and through each page I turn, I embrace the beauty and power of storytelling.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The Harry Potter film series, based on the beloved books by J.K. Rowling, has become a cultural phenomenon that has captivated audiences around the world. Spanning eight movies released between 2001 and 2011, the series chronicles the journey of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, as they navigate the challenges of growing up, attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and ultimately facing the dark forces of the evil Voldemort. With its enchanting blend of fantasy, adventure, and a rich, immersive world, the Harry Potter films have not only broken numerous box office records but have also left an indelible mark on the hearts and imaginations of millions, inspiring generations to believe in the magic within themselves.</p>


<p class="subtitle">The famous film series consist of eight movies in total:</p>

<div class="container"
 <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
   <li>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</li>
   <li>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</li>
   <li>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</li>
   <li>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</li>
   <li>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</li>
   <li>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</li>
   <li>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1</li>
   <li>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<p class="subtitle">The Harry Potter films have a special place in my heart because I have adored them since I was a young child. It has been a magical trip to watch Harry, Hermione, and Ron mature and overcome amazing obstacles in addition to the colourful but frightening realm of magic. The movies have always been comforting and inspirational, teaching wisdom on bravery, friendship, and the value of standing up for what is right. My mind has been captured by J.K. Rowling's vivid writing, enduring characters, and enchanted environment, which she brought to life on screen. These elements have allowed me to escape into a world where everything is possible. As years have passed, my admiration for the complexity and intricacy of the series has only increased, turning Harry Potter from a childhood favourite into a timeless tale that continues to captivate and fascinate me.</p>
